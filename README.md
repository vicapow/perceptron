## A template project setup

This is my preferred project setup. It includes React with JSX, TypeScript, Prettier, and TailwindCSS.

## Setup

First, install dependencies using

    yarn install

## Start the server

Start the server so that any changes to JavaScript or CSS files will be automatically re-compiled. This also sets up an HTTP server to serve the site at https://localhost:8080

    yarn start
